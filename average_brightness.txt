Define average_brightness, arguments: picture

    set the relative w/h to picture dimensions
    if the picture is excessively large
        scale the picture by 50%
        set the relative w/h to 50%

    set the total brightness to 0.
    for each pixel in the picture
        calculate the brightness of pixel
        add that calculated brightness to total

    find the total number of pixels using relative w/h
    calculate the average brightness
    return that value as a float
