For our project we have three enhancements: 

1. Resize:  A function imagescale() which adjusts the size of the 
picture.  This is a fairly common/important feature to have in image 
manipulation editor.  The scrollbar ability also helps heighten the user 
interction with the program.

2. Undo function() that converts the picture to the previous look.  Note, 
you cannot "undo" when you have just loaded the picture because you have not
done anything to the picture.

3. Mouse-click interaction:  For our crop function we decided to implement a 
click ability where the user loads a picture, clicks crop, and clicks on two 
points on the picture (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  This was extremely 
important and interactive ability in image editors, hence, we wanted the same 
performance.  We could have simply asked the user to enter random points in a 
dialog box, but we thought this was unamusing, simple, and uninteractive.
